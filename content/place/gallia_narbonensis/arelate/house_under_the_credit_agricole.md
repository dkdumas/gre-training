## Location Description

Arles was one of the pilgrimage sites on route to the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela. French pilgrimage routes to Compostela tend to follow old Roman roads, many of which continued to be utilized as primary roads of communication during the Middle Ages. Arles was a leading city of the west Roman Empire. It fell under Visigoth control during the 6th century and then under Muslims rule in 730. It has a Roman arena dating to the 1st century BCE, which is presently used for bullfights and plays. It also has many Roman ruins. Arles was home to Vincent van Gogh during a productive period of his career.

## House Description

This house at [14] on the map, was discovered in 1977 in an emergency salvage excavation. It was constructed about 180 and destroyed in the third quarter of the third century. The portion revealed was composed of four rooms, aligned in an east-west direction, with polychrome mosaic floors and a southern wall that was seemingly without openings. Along the north side, however, was a wide portico giving light and air to the rooms. Beyond it, there extended an area that was perhaps a garden.
