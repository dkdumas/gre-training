## House Description

This house stood southwest of the theater, on the Puymin hill, in the residential northeast quarter of the city.  Unearthed between 1927 and 1929, it covered a surface of about 3000 square meters.  A first stage was built around 40-30 B.C., followed by a considerable extension to the northeast in the first century A.D.. First interpreted as an official residence, a *praetorium*, by J. Sautel, it takes its present name from an arbor found in the garden.  The house, organized on at least three levels, was considerably worn down so that interpreting the different phases is not easy.

## Garden Description

The residential part best known was organized around a garden 17 by 20 meters, framed by three wings in a U.  At the center of the east wing, the bottom of the U, a grand stairway with two {curving?) symmetric ramps framing a niche (possibly for a statue) rose to the second storey where a portico overlooked the garden from three sides.  To the west, the fourth side of the garden was closed against the outside by a straight wall.  On it was supported a wall accented by a central apse (with a opening of 5.8 meters) centered on the axis of the garden.  Along this wall, but separated from it by a space, lie three related pools which are below the garden.  Built of masonry, one is semi-circular (3.85 meters in diameter) with a lateral set of stone steps for access, while the other two are symmetrically placed rectangles (2.4 by .85 meters).  No water jet was noted.  There was also a well with masonry rim in the southeastern part of the garden.

In the axis of the garden but a little off to the west is a structure with masonry walls in the form of a T, 7.15 m long.  On top of this wall has been reconstructed without proof a T-shaped arbor shading the site of a summer triclinium. {Is this arbor "reconstitué" mentally or in wood ?} We believe that if there were here a pergola it would have covered a banquet space organized in a T + U shape and built of wood  resting on the masonry of which only the T by itself is drawn. {Drawn in what sense?}

To the northeast of the house are remains in which it has been proposed to see a bath with a pool surrounded by a 3-by-5 colonnade.  This pool could have also have served as a water reservoir for irrigation of the tree-covered slopes and gardens below the hill of Puymin.
