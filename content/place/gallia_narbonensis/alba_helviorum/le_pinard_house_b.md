## House Description

This house is also 120 southwest of the theater, in front of house A.  Excavated in 1967-1968, the parcel covers 450 sq m, with a useful covered surface of 401.5 sq m.  It was constructed in the second century.  Only the southwest corner is known; the rest is lost or not excavated.

On entering from the east-west street, after passing through two incidental rooms, one comes into a vast space [1] occupied by a pool of about 2.5 x 3.5 m connected by a ditch to the sewer in the street.  This room, in which some see an atrium (?), may be a vestibule with pool connecting with the entrance of which the tower may have been treated as a garden (?). [This makes no sense to me; how can a tower be treated as a garden?  Maybe "tour" (tower) was supposed to be "cour" (courtyard).]
