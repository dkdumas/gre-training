## House Description

It was of high quality construction with eight black and white floor mosaics with occasional touches of color, columns and capitals in dressed stone, painted plaster, and a heated room. It was arranged in a U around a garden surrounded by a square peristyle 13.5 meters on a side. The principal room was in the center on the north side, looking south across a portico to the garden. The peristyle had eight columns on each side except the north, where the central two were missing to open the view of the garden from the main room. To judge by the foundations, the columns on either side of this opening were larger than the others. A rectangular pool (4.9 x 2.1 m.) on the garden side of this opening had a semicircular apse on its south side. It was probably about seventy or eighty centimeters deep; but the depth is uncertain, for the top has not been preserved. It was lined with *opus signinum* and had masonry quarterround to make the edges watertight. Around the garden, except at the pool, ran a *gutter* in dressed stone.
