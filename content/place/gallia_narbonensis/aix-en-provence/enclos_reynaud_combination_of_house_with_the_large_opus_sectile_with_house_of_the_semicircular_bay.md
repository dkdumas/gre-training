## House Description

In the second century, to judge by the style of the mosaics, the two preceding houses, NAR6.3 and NAR6.4, were joined without, however, any major change in plan. Fragments of statues have been found. With an area greater than 1500 square meters, pavements of high quality, and statuary, it must have been an imposing home. It was occupied for some two centuries.
