## Villa Description

In the locality of Muscapeu, at the foot of a slope, was found this villa.  Partial excavations in 1950 to 1960 exposed 4200 square meters.  Constructed in the first half of the first century B.C. , it was occupied until sometime in the third century.  An aqueduct from a spring supplied water.  The *pars urbana* is to the east; the *pars rustica* to the west.

In state 1, from a sort of podium, the *pars urbana*, 34.5 meters on a side, overlooked the surrounding fields.  At the center was a peristyle [1] (16.6 by 3.2 meters); and in the center, a rectangular pool (16.6 by 3.2 meters) with a bottom of *opus signinum*.  The drain came out of the southeast corner of the pool and flowed along the south façade.

The living quarters were between the colonnade of the peristyle [2] and that of the façade of the villa [3], which opened out onto the surrounding countryside.  In this northern wing, in the axis of the pool, was a reception room [4] completely open to the portico of the peristyle.  The other rooms of this wing are poorly known but they had floors with white mosaics with black borders and stone thresholds with sockets at the ends for the pins on which the doors pivoted.  In the southwest corner, a room with an apse, a floor of *opus signinum*, one part elevated and a square masonry base in the center has posed problems of interpretation: is a *lararium*, a place for religious services, or part of the baths to the west?

In a second stage, in the first century, a bath complex [5] with an open-air esplanade was built to the southwest of the peristyle.  In a third stage, these baths were redecorated with marble.  In a final stage, in the second century, new baths [6] were constructed to the west of the original complex, but the original was not abandoned.
