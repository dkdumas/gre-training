## Location Description

Ruins of large Roman baths, now surrounded by an interpretive center, and numerous finds of Roman coins and pottery fragments make clear that there was a considerable Roman town here with its center in the heart of the modern town.  Its name, however, has not been determined for certain.  The villa described below is near the modern town cemetery.  It seems, however, that the villa was reburied for its protection.

## Garden Description

A grey limestone block found in 1975 at La Alameda, between Toledo and Cordova, and now preserved in the Museo Provinciale di Ciuidad Real, records the dedication of a funerary grove (lucus) by Minicia Saturnina for her son T. Aemilius Vetus, who died at age thirty-five sometime in the late first or early second century AD.
